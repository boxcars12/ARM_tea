input goals as max 6DOF coordinates
    goals can be flexible/rigid
        flexible goals have size

input moats as sphere/cube

coordinate system for inputs sets operating surface as Z-plane

choose origin point for robot placement
    origin should be centrally located among goal points
    shifted as necessary and projected to Z plane
    redefine coordinates based on new reference frame

determine minimum DOF needed
    if all points lie on a plane - 2DOF
    if any goal is 3DOF and occupy 3 dimension - 3DOF Placeable
    if any goal is 4DOF - 4DOF Directable
    if any goal is 5DOF - 5DOF Pencilable
    if any goal is 6DOF - 6DOF Orientable

determine base configuration
    for 2DOF
        determine plane that goals lie in
            if Y-plane
                config = base - pitch - pitch
            if Z-plane
                config = crank - pitch
            if composite plane
                config = base ^ crank - pitch
    for 3DOF
        config = roll - pitch - pitch
    for 4DOF
        config = roll - pitch - pitch - roll
    for 5DOF
        config = roll - pitch - pitch - roll - pitch
    for 6DOF
        config = roll - pitch - pitch - roll - pitch - roll

apply minimum link lengths where applicable

identify farthest goal point

assign link lengths for pitch joints so as to reach goal point
    initially links will be of ratio X:1

check for interference with moat
    iteratively add bend between links to avoid moat
    if no interference add bend of 10deg

compute working volume

check to ensure all goals fall within working volume
    if not, iteratively adjust link lengths until condition is true

determine inverse kinematics for each goal

check for interference with moats

plan path between goals

check points in between goals for interference
    search depth will be specified
    for every level of depth the distance between goals will be halved and each additional node checked

where collisions are unavoidable, add DOF
