input goals as max 6DOF coordinates
    goals can be flexible/rigid
        flexible goals have size

input moats as sphere/cube

coordinate system for inputs sets operating surface as Z-plane

choose origin point for robot placement
    origin should be centrally located among goal points
    shifted as necessary
    redefine coordinates based on new reference frame

determine minimum DOF needed
    if all points lie on a plane - 2DOF
    if any goal is 3DOF and occupy 3 dimension - 3DOF Placeable
    if any goal is 4DOF - 4DOF Directable
    if any goal is 5DOF - 5DOF Pencilable
    if any goal is 6DOF - 6DOF Orientable
